is this bassically our final?
this was our final
we can make changes to it and make things better

also about the app
when we starting?
i still have to get the licence from them

yea i hear ya
what all do we have to do still?

admin section

i think thats the only big thing left
hmm ok
how an
d it would also be great not having everything need and new file made for it


<------ this is crazy. im sure we dont need all those damn files
well if you figure that out fine but we could just put them all in folders and make them easier to find but youre right
i think ima make a new class and split the user class

ok

i will probably start on the admin front end later today or tomorrow

cool and make a list of stuff we need to do and we can work on it.. also we need to get that db onto a live thing
just incase we need to change something

i will check on the one we started on

i still have access to it so i can upload the new db and shit

but you will have to get it opened up so that it can be accessed on campus

yea just give me the ports and shit
ill ask

ok
